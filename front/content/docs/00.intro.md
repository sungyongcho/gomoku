# Intro

Gomoku is a two-player strategy board game played on a **19x19** grid. Players take turns placing black and white stones on empty intersections, aiming to achieve one of the following win conditions:

1. Five or more stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
2. Capturing a specific number of opponent's stones, called the goal (e.g., capturing 10 stones = 5 pairs)

The first player to accomplish either of these conditions wins the game.

```js
const a = 1;
const a = 1;
const a = 1;
const a = 1;
const a = 1;
```
