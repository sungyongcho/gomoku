# Basic Rules

The following are the fundamental rules of our Gomoku implementation:

- **Black plays first**, and players alternate turns.
- A stone can be captured if it is placed in a way that **sandwiches two of the opponent’s stones** between the new stone and another of the player’s stones.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 -sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4">
	<img src="/images/capture-1.png" alt="before capture" class="sm:h-full" />
	<img src="/images/capture-2.png" alt="after capture" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

- **No double-threes**: A move is forbidden if it simultaneously creates **two open sequences of three stones** (known as "free-threes"), which would offer a guaranteed path to victory by alignment.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 -sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4">
	<img src="/images/double-three-1.png" alt="double three case 1" class="sm:h-full" />
	<img src="/images/double-three-2.png" alt="double three case 2" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

- **Exception to the double-three rule**: A move that would normally be forbidden due to the double-three rule **is allowed if it captures a pair of the opponent’s stones**.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 -sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4">
	<img src="/images/double-three-exception-1.png" alt="double three exception 1" class="sm:h-full" />
	<img src="/images/double-three-exception-2.png" alt="double three exception 2" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

## Win Conditions

A player can win in one of the following ways:

- **By alignment**: A player who aligns **five or more consecutive stones** wins — **but only if** the opponent **cannot immediately break** the alignment by capturing part of it.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 -sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4">
	<img src="/images/five-stone.png" alt="Black win" class="sm:h-full" />
	<img src="/images/five-stone-breakable.png" alt="Continue game" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

- **By capture**: If a player has already lost four pairs (i.e., 8 stones), and the opponent is in a position to capture **one more pair**, the opponent wins by capture.
