# Optional Rules

In this game, you can enable or disable rules to customize your Gomoku experience. These optional rules are designed to add strategic depth and balance to gameplay.

## 1. Capture

When the `Capture` Rule is active, the following settings are available:

- `Goal`: The number of captures required to win the game. For example, if the goal is set to 5, a player who captures 5 paris (i.e., 10 stones) wins immediately regardless of alignment.

- `Advantage`: This value allows you to start the game with a predefined number of captures already counted. It can be used to give one player an initial edge or to adjust balance between players.

## 2. Double Three Restriction

- If enabled: The game will detect and prevent moves that would result in a double-three situation.
- If disabled: Players are allowed to play double-threes, which can lead to more aggressive tactics and quicker victories.
